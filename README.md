## Project "Stray Dogs"

One of my land most prominent problem is the presence of thousands stray dogs who were abandoned by people on vacation
Fortunally there are a lot well organized groups to handle with care every dog abandoned or lost
My project is to promote the adoption of these poor beasts by offering coupons to the turists who are willing to adopt
15% coupons up to 25% for every rest and relax activity in the territory if they are willing to adopt a stray dog 
The client initially pays the fees entirely (hotels,travels,etc) then when they adopt 15% will be given back.
Hotels and AirBnb won't have to lower the price because the refound for the client will be covered by EU funds to promote
the tourism and territory.
First thing is to create a database of every dog in the shelter. Then associate the dog to a coupon and redirect to the 
hotel reservation. Services will have to choose to get the full amount of money or to invest the 15% fee in polkadot
and receive them at the end of the season, beeing aware of the risks and benefits of this transaction.
